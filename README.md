## Pre-installed Essential Dependencies

To streamline your development process, I've already installed some essential dependencies for you. These include:

- SCSS: A powerful styling preprocessor to enhance your CSS workflow.
- Axios: A versatile HTTP client for making asynchronous requests to servers.
- React Router DOM: A routing library for managing navigation in your React applications.
- React Helmet Async: A tool for managing document head tags, such as <title> and <meta>.

By including these dependencies from the start, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon and accelerate your development.

Feel free to explore additional libraries and tools as you continue to refine your React project. Happy coding!
