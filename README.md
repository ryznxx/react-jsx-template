# Getting Started with React JSX

Welcome to the world of JSX templates in React! Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, diving into JSX can be an exciting journey.

### Setting Up Your Folder Structure

Let's begin by establishing a clear folder structure for your project. Here's a breakdown of how I've organized it:

```plaintext
- public
- src
  - features
  - assets
  - containers
    - components
    - pages
```

This structured approach will make it easier to navigate and maintain your codebase as your project evolves.

### Pre-installed Essential Dependencies

To streamline your development process, I've already installed some essential dependencies for you. These include:

- SCSS: A powerful styling preprocessor to enhance your CSS workflow.
- Axios: A versatile HTTP client for making asynchronous requests to servers.
- React Router DOM: A routing library for managing navigation in your React applications.
- React Helmet Async: A tool for managing document head tags, such as `<title>` and `<meta>`.

By including these dependencies from the start, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon and accelerate your development.

Feel free to explore additional libraries and tools as you continue to refine your React project. Happy coding!
